For the class I made on this topic, I made two exercicies in a spreadsheet.

1. The first exercicie is about [unit balancing](https://valdiviadev.github.io/RTS-balancing-research/#unit-balancing). In this exercice you are given an initial set of units 
(**Swordsman**, **Gunman** and **F. machine**), as indicated in the spreadsheet.
With this first set of units, you have to try and make a balanced set with three extra units 
(**Knight**, **Archer** and **Dragon**) that have their values put to zero. Don't 
edit the initial unit's parameter cells or the cost and type cells of the new units. To realize this exercice you just have to edit the 
HP and DPS cells.

**Note**: Also, don't edit the transposed matrix down below the main payoff table. But you can of course erase the transposed table and
experiment with a non-symetrical set of enemy units, if you desire.

2. This second exercice is about [build rate](https://valdiviadev.github.io/RTS-balancing-research/#build-rate). In this exercice you 
are given a set types of resources with their own rarity index, and the base unit's construction time and resources. With this, you need 
to achieve for every entity on the table, the seconds of build time that are indicated in the right cells in colour green. To do this you need to modify 
the resource cells of every unit, upgrade or construction. There are some resource cells though, that you cannot modify; these cells are marked on blue.
It is recomended that in every entity that has two resource cells printed in blue, you modify the other two cells, and not just one.

You have the permision to use and modify this spreadsheets however you want.
