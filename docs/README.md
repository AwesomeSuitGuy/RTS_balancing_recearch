My name is David Valdivia and I'm a student from the videogames design and development degree at the
Polytechnic University of Catalonia. This website contains a research about RTS videogames
(real time strategy games) balancing.

Game balance is the concept and action of shaping a game’s rules with the object to make this game’s rules and systems effective. Game balancing is a really important aspect to take in account both in board games and in video games, because an unbalanced game, in other words, a game with poor and/or unfair mechanics and systems; is a boring game to play, at its best; and a frustrating and unfair game to play, at its worst.

Of course, this is no different to real-time-strategy ([RTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy)) video games. Balance in these types of games is extremely important as they are, as its name says, video games where the player has to ideate a strategy to complete a level or scenario, in individual 1 player RTS video games, and ideate an even more intricate and complex strategy to beat a human rival in competitive RTS video games.

In this research document I’ll be explaining some useful methods to make a balanced RTS video game in it’s most important systems and elements to balance. This systems that I’ll be tackling are; the unit system, technology trees (tech trees for short), artificial intelligence and maps or stages.
